## :wave: Overview

Welcome to my home operations repository.

Lots of fun (to me at least :wink:) stuff can be found, poke around my [Kubernetes clusters](./k8s/clusters/) directory to see what they are running. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/dcplaya/home-ops/issues/new).

For more information, head on over to my [docs](https://dcplaya.github.io/home-ops/).

## :handshake:&nbsp; Thanks

A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from the people that have shared their clusters over at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes) Huge shoutout to the [home-ops](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh) discord channel

## Installation Notes

No notes since this changes constantly. Currently, bootstrap a talos cluster and then shove Flux into it.
